                    <p>From prehistoric times until the present, cooking has provided sustenance for humans. Since then, cooking has evolved from a means of survival to an art and a discipline.</p>

                    <p>Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaraunts and other food establishments.</p>

                    <p>Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for the same does not predate more than 1 million years.</p>

                    <p>The precise origins of cooking are unknown, but, at some point in the distant past, early humans conquered fire and started using it to prepare food. Researchers have found what appear to be the remains of campfires made 1.5 million years ago by Homo erectus, one of the early human species.</p>

                    <p>The oldest form of cooking is basically fire-roasting and, specifically, open fire cooking. The earliest forms of open-fired cooking would have consisted of placing food ingredients straight into a fire. Yep, right into the ashes! Some indigenous societies still cook in this way.</p>
