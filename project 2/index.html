            <h2>Welcome to Wild vs Domestic Animals!</h2>
            <p>The difference between domesticated animals and wild animals is pretty simple. Domesticated animals have been born and bred for many generations to live alongside humans, while wild animals have not and still live in “the wild”, or in their natural habitats.</p>

            <p>Domestic animals such as dogs, cats, and cattle have been selectively bred and genetically adapted over generations to live alongside humans. They are genetically distinct from their wild ancestors or cousins. Animal domestication falls into three main groupings: domestication for companionship (dogs and cats), animals farmed for food (sheep, cows, pigs, turkeys, etc.), and working or draft animals (horses, donkeys, camels).</p>
